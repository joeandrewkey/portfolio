This portfolio is a collection of assorted works that demonstrate my ability 
to solve interesting problems in a variety of programming languages.

Currently, I have only uploaded some Python.  I will try to limit my entries
to the best 5 or 6 in each language.  Soon you will also see examples of:
1.  Java
2.  SQL
3.  Cassandra
4.  ElasticSearch
5.  Ruby
6.  Javascript/AJAX
7.  Erlang/OTP
8.  Shell scripting
9.  Hadoop
10.  C#/.NET
11.  Hive
