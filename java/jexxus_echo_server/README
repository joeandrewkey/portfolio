This is a server that responds to all requests by echoing the result.

It's sole purpose is to demonstrate Jexxus as a clean and concise way to write client and server code.  Future plans are to re-write the Python asynchronous key/value server I wrote in Java using Jexxus for the networking code.  I may also be fun to write a Poker server and client program and ask 5 clients to play a million rounds of Poker with each client using a different strategy to see which one strategy prevails most often.

What is Jexxus?
It is an open-source Java network library that you can find here:
