#Objective: Provide a very quick, O(n), method for finding the "best" X items
#	in an unordered list.  This solution scales linearly, and benefits from
#	not having to sort all items in the list.  Instead, it compares each
#	item to the current worst item in the sorted list of best X items. 

#Exit with informative message if there is not exactly 1 parameter
if len(sys.argv) != 2:
	print "usage: python " + sys.argv[0] + " <number_of_results>"
	sys.exit(0)
number_of_results = int(sys.argv[1]) #set this to the number of results you want

#This is an unsorted list of movies.  Each movie is a dictionary with a:
#	1.  "mmid" - Unique movie identifier
#	2.  "name" - Name of the movie
#	3.  "ranking" - from 0 (worst) to 10 (best) rating for the movie
