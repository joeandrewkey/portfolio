#Objective: Implement quicksort (aka "partition-exchange" sort) that makes 
#on average, O(n log n) comparisons to sort n items.  This solution benefits
#from "list comprehensions", which keeps the syntax concise and easy to read.
def quicksort(list):
	# an empty list is already sorted, so just return it
	if list == []:
		return list
	else:
		#select a random pivot and remove it from the list
		pivot = list.pop(randrange(len(list)))
		#filter all items less than the pivot and quicksort them
		lesser = quicksort([l for l in list if l < pivot])
		#filter all items greater than the pivot and quicksort them
		greater = quicksort([l for l in list if l >= pivot])
		#return the sorted results 
		return lesser + [pivot] + greater
